# Weather-App
Project Title: Python Weather App

Description:
The Python Weather App is a program developed in Python that leverages an API to retrieve current weather information based on user input. The app allows users to input a city of their choice and promptly displays the current weather conditions for that city. 

Key Features:
1. User Input: Users can input the name of the city they want to get weather information for.
2. API Integration: The program integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data for the specified city.
3. Data Retrieval: Upon receiving the user's input, the app makes a request to the API and retrieves relevant weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
4. Data Display: The fetched weather information is displayed to the user in a clear and concise manner.
5. Error Handling: The app includes error handling to manage invalid user inputs or API request failures, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
6. User-Friendly Interface: The app offers a simple and intuitive interface, guiding users through the process of inputting their desired city and viewing the weather information.

Overall, the Python Weather App provides users with an easy way to access current weather conditions for any city, helping them plan their activities accordingly.
